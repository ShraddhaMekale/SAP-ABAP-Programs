                                        Enhancements & Modifications

Enhancements - We will enhance the SAP functionality in Customer namespace( Z or Y).
Modifications - We will enhance the SAP functionality in SAP namespace( Name should not start with Z or Y).



Types of Enhancements & Modifications 

1) Implicit & Explicit Enhancements -  Enhancement
2) Customer Exit( Function Module Exit , Menu Exit, Screen Exit) - Enhancement
3) BADI( Business Addin's) - Enhancements
4) User Exit - Modification

1) Implicit & Explicit Enhancements

Implict Enhancement - Implicit point is available at the starting or at the last of the program , 
                      Sub routines, Function modules etc.
                      We will create the Implicit Implementation using those points.

Explict Enhancement - Explicit point & Section are available at any point. We will create the Explicit implementations using those points and sections.

Enhancement-point -- You can only add additional codes, you cannot change or replace the existing code.
                     1. It will not give default implementation.
                     2. Along with standard code your implementation also executed
                     3. You can only add additional codes, you cannot replace the existing code
                       
Enhancment-section -- You can change or replace the existing SAP code.
                     1. It will give default implementation 
                     2. Only your implementation will execute 
                     3. You can change or replace the existing SAP code

Enhancement Spot : Enhancement spots are containers for explicit enhancement options.

Program : LEINBF0M


2) Customer Exit - It is also called as Function Exit.

   Ways to Find a Customer Exit -      1) Put the break-point on the statment CALL CUSTOMER-FUNCTION.
                                       2) Put the package name in SMOD transaction code( Path : Utilities - Find - Package name).
                                       3) Go to transaction code - SE84( Path : Enhancements - Customer Exits) 


  Steps to Implement a Customer Exit -

 1) Go to transaction code - CMOD
 2) Provide a project name and click create.
 3) Click on Enhancement assignment tab and provide the customer exit name.
 4) Click on Components tab - It will navigate you to function module.
 5) Write the logic in the Z include of that function module.
 6) Activate the project. 

Tables & Transaction codes :

1) SMOD -> To find customer Exit.
2) CMOD -> To Implement a customer Exit.
3) MODSAP -> To find the customer exit name by passing the function module.
4) MODACT -> To find the project for a customer exit name.


Relationship between a project and Customer Exit name -> 1:1


Menu Exit -> 

Menu exits add menu items to standard SAP applications.
These special entries have function codes that begin with "+" (a plus sign) - +CUS

Screen Exit->

The screen type of the screen is Subscreen.

                                                             User Exit.

User Exit are modifications. They are only available in SAP SD( Sales & distribution) module. 
They are available in the form of a Sub routines.

Ways to find out a User Exit.

1) Check the documentation of the program.
2) Search for Key word - PERFORM USEREXIT
3) Search in  Package : VMOD

The Most Important User Exit's of SAP SD module are available in program : MV45AFZZ.


FORM USEREXIT_MOVE_FIELD_To_VBAK.

ENDFORM.




                                                         BADI

1) BADI is an Enhancement.
2) The full form of BADI is Business ADD In's.
3) It is based upon OOPS concepts( Interfaces & Classes).
4) SE18 -> BADI Definition( Interface)
5) SE19->  BADI Implementation( Classes)

Types of BADI:

1) Classic BADI
2) New BADI( Kernel BADI)

How to find a classic BADI ->  

1) We can use SAP class - CL_EXITHANDLER. In this class we have the method name - GET_INSTANCE.
2) Pass the package name in SE18 transaction code
  ( Path : Click on F4 help of BADI name->New Selection->Pass the package name).
3) Pass the package name in SE84 transaction code(Enhancements-Business Addin's-Definition). 

How to find a new BADI

1) Put the break-point on Key word - CALL BADI or GET BADI.
2) Pass the package name in SE18 transaction code
  ( Path : Click on F4 help of BADI name->New Selection->Pass the package name).
3) Pass the package name in SE84 transaction code(Enhancements-Business Addin's-Definition).

Multiple Use -> We can create multiple Implementations.
SAP Internal -> Only for SAP Use.

Difference between classic BADI and New BADI

1) In Classic BADI, there is no Enhancement Spot.In New BADI there is an enhancement spot.
2) In Classic BADi, the name of the Implementing class automatically appears. 
   In New BADI we need to provide the implementing class name.
                     
Real time Implementation: 

Classical BADi Example : 

Transaction code : MM01
BADI Definition : BADI_MATERIAL_CHECK
Interface : IF_EX_BADI_MATERIAL_CHECK
Method : CHECK_DATA

New BADI Definition Example(MM01) : 

Transaction code : MM02
Enhancement Spot : EHSPS_SPOT_PS_SPEC
BADI Definition : BADI_EHSS_AUTH_CHECK
Interface : IF_EX_BADI_EHSS_AUTH_CHECK
Method : AT_SAVE_CHECK
